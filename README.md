# üß† Breast Cancer Detection using PyCaret

üéóÔ∏è This project uses **PyCaret**, a low-code machine learning library, to detect breast cancer based on tumor features from the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**. The objective is to classify tumors as **benign** or **malignant** with high accuracy using an automated pipeline.

---

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Repository](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
- **Features**: 30 numeric features computed from digitized images of breast masses.
- **Target**: `diagnosis` - M = Malignant, B = Benign

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **PyCaret** (for ML automation)
- **Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib** (for data handling and visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for development)

## üìà Model Performance

| Metric       | Score |
|--------------|-------|
| Accuracy     | ‚úÖ 96-98% (based on selected model) |
| Precision    | High (less false positives) |
| Recall       | High (saves lives üíØ) |
| Confusion Matrix | ‚úîÔ∏è Included in Notebook |

> ‚ö° Powered by PyCaret‚Äôs `compare_models()` and `evaluate_model()` functions.
